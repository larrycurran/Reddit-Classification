realization ovi is the most significant athlete in dc sports history,caps,295,cgtvyc,101,2019-07-23 19:15:40,this occured to me this morning and i am saying this as someone for whom the caps are not even my number one team nor hockey my number one sport  sorry not sorry  love this place but football and my beleaguered skins will always be my first crush  nbsp  anyways yeah yeah there are plenty of athletes across the different dc sports holding various awards championships and claims to fame but the way i see it ovi wins hands down by virtue of the statue test  nbsp  some writer for the athletic wrote some crazy but hear me out what if article which had ovi traded to the knights at some point  the author fully acknowledged it was some pipe dream just for content writing but it still made me think of something  nbsp  i was thinking out that argument that yeah yeah but obviously ovi wouldnt leave more importantly ted would do whatever it took to hold onto him because apart from on the ice ovi is the most important human to the capitals and all of monumental sports speaking strictly in terms of brand identity  he is the face of that whole arena  nbsp  the talking point that comes to mind here is   within a year of his retirement id guarantee you theyre erecting a statue of him right out front of the building  like cal ripken or ray lewis  you dont trade the kind of guy you have to build a statue for the day he leaves  nbsp  cal ripken   ray lewis  then it dawned on me  im a dc sports fan  im not a baltimore fan  but baltimore examples come to mind  why not dc examples    what dc examples  nbsp  a career player a first ballot hall of famer and  an icon so central to the franchise that its already a given  theyll put up a statue of him in front of the building and probably a street name passing by it  nbsp  how many players in dcs history can we say that about    one  its just ovi  thats the whole list    so by the statue test i think you have to argue that ovi is a clear head above every other sports legend the in the citys timeline  thoughts  agree disagree

kempny is a huge factor of this team and he is one of my favorites on this team in this essay i will explain,caps,149,bi07rh,12,2019-04-27 19:32:35,one of the reasons that caps lost is bc of the defense it was obvious that there was a void kempny is so crucial for this team he can play on his left side which is a rare spot for dmen and got that toughness and smartness what the team needed i mean he is insanely resilient he get hit in face all the time and still come back into the game like it was nothing the injury against tampa bay was unfortunate and untimely   i remember last year when we acquired kempny in a trade we didnt think much about it but he made defense into a major factor in the cup run him and carlson on the same line were insane together to come think of it that is the best acquisition we got in the past years the stanley cups winning team comes with many storylines of what got to where we are now his storyline is heartwarming but it was overlooked bc of ovi and backy and the other star players on the team not theres anything wrong about that  he was undrafted from czech came into chicago he was great but often scratched alot coach q wasnt confident in him he felt unwanted and have decided to leave nhl and go back to czech the very next year within that same year he was traded to the caps where reirden and trotz have their confidence in him and paired him with carlson which at the time needed a designated partner he then became a major piece in their cup run and himself won a cup over the summer he signed onto a 5 years contract and designated to stay in the nhl that is insane imagine if he was never traded to the caps we may have not won the cup he would have gone back to czech we wouldnt have seen what he could do  looking back i would have no idea how big of an influence this guy on this team an undrafted often scratched dman then becomes a 1st line dman along with carlson we got this guy and developed him into this amazing defender and no one would thought of it this is why gmbm is great at his job this is why kempny should be recognized as a great dman in the league rn and this is why we should recognize kempny more often    thank you for coming to my ted talk

fans thoughts on kuzy being 2nd line center,caps,8,dghano,12,2019-10-11 20:06:22,so ive been thinking about this for a little bit first off ive been a fan of the caps since before the ovechkin era and 2018 was a long overdue cup for the boys that being said when we won kuzy played on the top line with ovi and willy and also led the league in playoff points   but then shortly after our celebration we lost trotz and todd was called up to me it seems as though ever since he got the nod as head coach backy has been back lol up on the first line   dont mistake this for backy hate tbh i think our squad his year is amazing and ive always loved watching the swede play alongside the great8 but this is where im a little confused  i understand that both kuzy and backy are 1st line material but it seemed as though backy had better chemistry with oshie and vrana while kuzy had it better playing on the top line   so why the change if somethings not broken dont fix it to me the lines should look like without specific wings just parings  8  92 43 13 19 77 62 20 14 28 18 21   i wanna know if im missing some reason as to why they changed it back or we can discuss the two and pros  cons but dont chirp were all caps fans here

favorite games from the 201819 regular season,caps,35,cyavl4,24,2019-09-01 18:52:59,even though the playoffs are where its at i often feel like the regular season is easily forgotten despite how great it is with next season just one more month away i want to know what some of your favorite games of last season were capsfam here are my top 5  5 101018 vs vgk w 52  a thrashing against the hated golden knights reminding them that they got burned in the cup final kuzy was on fire this night  4 111318  min w 52  a win for copley which helped to build his confidence is always fantastic but the real story here is that this night was one that 30 other teams long feared for tonight elite sniper stanley cup champion tom wilson was freed from the gates of the dops and boy did he deliver not only did he net his first goal of a monstrous season but he also got the willy treatment in a totally unjustified goaltender interference on that goal   3 033019  tbl w 63  nothing less than a complete dismantling of the hottest team in the nhl at the time it is unfortunate we werent able to play them again in the playoffs after this textbook defeat ovi netting 50 and 51 was the icing on the cake  2 100318 vs bos w 70  i would not be surprised if this is first choice for most caps fans and it makes a damn good case for it we were relentless right out of the gate after an emotional banner raising ceremony a shutout for holtbeast is always great too gotta give an honorable mention to dowds ridiculous goal this night if you dont remember it you better go look it up  1 11192018  mtl w 54 ot  the reason that this is my 1 is simply that it was a damn great hockey game at the beginning of november montreal humiliated us with a crushing defeat while we were still trying to establish some consistency for the season this game had all the elements of a good onea strong back and forth for the entire game 2 goals for ovi and over 10 caps putting up at least a point for the night what really made this game stand out was the last few minutes before ot price and ovi more or less had a 1v1 where ovechkin was firing some brutal shots only for carey price to bring out some serious acrobatics to stop them i loved the little congratulatory clap ovi gave after he saved a near impossible shot ot was bitter sweet as eller netted the final goal of the game to a serenade of boos from the home crowd  edit a typo

ilya samsonov and vitek vanecek will be one of the best goalie tandems in the near future,caps,28,cqs13y,18,2019-08-15 20:17:42,as holtby enters his final year of his contract the future looks bleak for him to be staying in dc looking at bobrovskys or vasilevskiys contract both nearing 10 mill avv comparing their achievements to holtby he is much more valuable with a cup and a vezina in his name and having successful stats in the playoffs with  928 svv 209 gaa and 7 shutouts bobrovsky have won only one playoff series and that comes from last season in a sweep against the tampa bay lightning he also won two vezinas but thats about it in his achievements vasilevskiy won a vezina last season and made three trips to eastern conference finals two as the backup and one as the starter he is still significantly young and there could be potential in the lightning goaltender to sum it up holtby have far more achievements and relatively is more successful in the postseason hence he is going to get paid more than these two goaltenders backstrom is also on his last year of his contract too and its very obvious that backstrom will be the one chosen to stay here unless holtby takes a discount to stay a few more years holtbys time in dc is potentially to be over after this season   what does this say about our future between the pipes pheonix copley ilya samsonov and vitek vanecek are the other remaining goaltenders in the nhl and the ahl assuming that the caps will protect samsonov in the seattle expansion draft its more likely that copley will go its sad to know that a franchise goaltender is gonna be gone and that its backup is gonna be taken away but the future is bright samsonov and vanecek will take over the pipes and will be the backends of the caps for the next decade even possibly being one of the best tandems in the league  upon drafting vitek vanecek 39th overall in the 2nd round of the 2014 nhl entry draft he showed strong stats in the chl with 921 svv and 264 gaa in 38 games he showed the average of 883 svv and 316 gaa in his 8 trips to the juniors for the czech republic team while the stats dont look as good as usual overseas he was better off in north america dividing his time between hershey bears in the ahl and south carolina stingrays in the echl he showed strong svv all above 900 and his gaa is around 200 and 260 range in his first full season in hershey and sharing the net with samsonov he posted 907 svv and 262 gaa in 38 games  the very next year the caps took the best goalie prospect of the 2015 nhl entry draft at 22nd overall pick ilya samsonov he showed stellar stats at 2015 u18 world juniors before being drafted from there he showed immense success playing the khl mhl and world juniors despite the rough start at the beginning of the season in ahl he improved very quickly on after his first shutout in january he adjusted and found his flow posting 930 svv and 178 gaa by then although his season in hershey was rocky posting 898 svv and 270 gaa in 37 games he is still very much young at 22 years old thus giving him more time to adjust and be ready for the nhl when holtby and copley are gone   while fans are more hyped about samsonov because he was the best goaltender out of his draft class and his stats in the khl and at world juniors were insane we shouldnt count vanecek out vanecek showed massive improvement adjusting to north american hockey he recently signed a three years contract first year twoway second and third oneway this contract provides comfort that vanecek will be the 2nd goalie on the roster after holtby most likely leaves this will create more time for samsonov to develop till copley is gone so expect vanecek to see some nhl time this season vanecek and samsonov played an equal amount of games in the ahl showing consistency between the two and helping the workload hopefully that consistency can transferred over to the nhl making their tandem even more successful these two goaltenders have amazing potential and nothing is stopping their development  upon looking at these stats and the success that these goaltenders have in the net in the affiliates and their continued successful development it is likely that the capitals will still remain a successful team in coming years in three years time you will see samsonov and vanecek on the opening night roster ready to take the league by storm with their lethal tandem

suggest me which game to attend,caps,4,c5og1v,8,2019-06-26 15:01:56,im traveling to new york in november and im planning to visit dc too there is a home game on the 23rd against canucks which in theory i can attend but i was planning to do dc 2022 there is a game in new york on 20th or something like that so that would fit better with my other arrangements the downsides of the new york game would that its an away game and it would probably be more expensive too upside though is a nice rivalry to watch and it would fit better with my schedule basically i guess my question is is home game against out of conference team at 1230 better than a division rivalry away

gm brian maclellan is one of the best gms in the league in this essay i will explain,caps,27,c1hi8m,8,2019-06-17 05:16:17,our current gm brian maclellen is amazing at his job and very underrated and should be regarded one of the best gms in the league today in this essay i will explain  heres the backstory on him he was assistant gm under george mcphee and before that he was the director of player personnel george mcphee was the man behind our core of the team notable for drafting ovi backy kuzy holts willy etc he is a great gm especially what he did with vgk in their first ever season however he will always be known as the guy who traded forsberg for erat and latta a trade that will be talked throughout the league for years to come by  since 2014 when promoted to gm maclellan did amazing he drafted notable players like vrana and samsonov but that is not his best skill of his job he have made amazing trades that helped our team to the cup win and even now too in his 5th year as gm going into 20192020 season he did very significant trades that helped us so   the most notable ones come to mind is the kempny  and the oshie trade michal kempny is a top 4 dman and usually plays side by side with carlson he helped our defensive depth when the caps were struggling with it in the mid of 20172018 season he was an undrafted dman with the blackhawks played only 81 games in his two years with the team he was scouted intensely by maclellan and it payed off in the end he blossomed into a player that gmbm was solely expecting he also managed to get an american hero tj oshie for brouwer copley who was given back to the caps in the shattenkirk trade and caps 2016 3rd round which was also given back to the caps too to draft garrett pilon so in reality caps got tj oshie for just simply brouwer to think about it its insane and smart too  even in the 20182019 season he made good trades acquiring hagelin to solve the problems in the pk and for the speed getting nick jensen in to solve defensive problems and puckmoving as rmnbs peter hassett have perfectly said in his article regarding gmbm and the niskanengudas trade when the caps lacked finishing he got tj oshie when the caps needed better twoway play he got justin williams when the bottomsix forwards needed reinforcements he got lars eller when defensive depth was sketchy he got michal kempny when transition play was lacking he got nick jensen when the team got slow he got carl hagelin this excerpt emphasizes how good gmbm is at his job when looking for solutions to caps problems  all the moves and acquisitions were all well thought out and were deeply scouted by gmbm and it payed off in the long run the mans ability to find solutions to underlying problems of the team is very impressive and significant this is why he should be recognized for his job among the league and should be highly regarded thanks for coming to my ted talk

likely scenario for the defense,caps,4,bk0ua8,9,2019-05-03 02:09:31,there have been lots of talk ab the caps defense and how it sucked in the regular and playoffs the nisky and orlov line is absolute horrendous like its garbage orpik while i love that guy and he is a veteran tough blueliner hes done for us this is what i hope in the offseason i hope they trade nisky he is 32 and he is taking 575 mill per year till 202021 that way the cap space is freed up to sign vrana hags conno burky whoever and possibly extend backy andor holts then jens can move up and partner with orlov on the second line as of djoos idk what is gmbm is going to do whether to resign him or not but either him or siegs can play on right third line and maybe someone from hershey like johansen or someone they have signed or gotten in a trade can fill in that left third line nisky being traded is a very likely scenario and i wouldnt have any problems with it as they need some money for the cap space what do you guys think

which jersey to buy,caps,7,bjeyog,16,2019-05-01 13:04:09,came in under budget for april and im looking to spend some of that extra money on a new caps jersey i currently only own a 0607 ovi jersey that has seen better days in terms of wear  tear and fit im considering grabbing a new ovi jersey that actually fits but i do already own an ovi jersey that still works for now and theres so many great players i dont own yet but if i go with one of then then id like to get someone that will stick with the team for a while thoughts  also i kinda like the away look better but im hesitant to get the white because it doesnt stand out from other teams as much and it will stain easier  maybe i should just wait til september  any input is greatly appreciated

no matter what happens tonight im proud of this team,Nationals,423,dbqc77,108,2019-10-01 12:30:37,lets go back to where we were on the morning of may 24  the nationals had been swept by the mets to fall to 1931 on pace to lose 101 games the team was the laughingstock of rbaseball all but certain to miss the postseason two seasons in a row for the first time since it started making the postseason   things werent much better here in rnationals in the words of ugummy_joe who authored the top comment in the may 23 postgame thread   this season is an astounding catastrophe of failure to execute professional baseball on every level the bullpen is the brightest dumpster fire in the back alley behind the arbys in this regard but defensive and offensive miscues have also come often enough to stoke the flaming garbage piles that is this team the offense is okayish the top three rotation guys are the only thing that occasionally yanks our heads above water for quick gasps of air before plunging back under everything else is just spineless sagging sloppy subpar sickening baseball that wrenches at your stomach churns your bowels and mocks your inept dance moves the nats are the pizza burn on the roof of baseballs mouth an atomic wedgie on the soul of dc and a 72slide microsoft powerpoint presentation thats nothing but text to every loyal nats fan who even began to hope that daveys soul crushing ineptitude last year was just because of an ancient family curse on the martinezes warning them should the camels hump present too soonyou and your team shall be faced with doom  in summation ugummy_joe said this fucking sucks  it did fucking suck   we had entered the season as part of what we thought was going to be an exciting fourteam race for the division we had signed patrick corbin shaken up the bullpen and moved on from some guy who i think plays in pennsylvania now but now we were facing what seemed like a lost season that might have lasting repercussions for the franchise in the short term the firing of davey martinez and virtually everyone agreed that he was going to get fired in the long term a potential fire sale with rumors that we might even trade max scherzer  and then something happened   im not sure when maybe it was when martinez threw a tantrum at home plate that sunday in may in any case the team started winning again they clawed themselves back to 500 by the end of june and they kept winning now its oct 1 and the nats somehow finished the season with 93 wins   there may be a time in the future when a casual fan glances back at the 2019 standings and sees something uninteresting the nationals 9369 four games back of the braves a closeish division race  that topline number doesnt explain how impressive of a turnaround the team pulled off for example it was the first time in 105 years that a team went from 12 games under 500 to 24 games over and only two teams in the history of baseball have started as poorly as the nationals did in 2019 and made the playoffs the 1974 pirates started 1832 finished 8874 and the 2005 astros started 1832 finished 8973 and made the world series  but we should be used to crazy turnarounds by now right usually were on the receiving end the 60 collapse in game 5 of the 2012 nlds the 18inning heart breaker in 2014 the blown call in 2017  speaking of crazy stats heres another one the nationals have never won a postseason game in which max scherzer made a pitching appearance   so if we lose tonight well endure another year of postseason jokes at our expense scherzers streak gets a game longer well add the 2019 wild card game to the list when the dust settles maybe well be able to appreciate the historic 7438 run that bought the team another chance to return to october  but heres the thing maybe like on may 24 the situation has already changed and we just dont know it yet maybe our time of enduring painful loss after painful loss is over maybe well win  and maybe well keep winning if we can overcome a 1931 start whos to say cant we win a postseason series or make it to the world series or win it  this season has already shown us how baseball can make you believe and lose faith and believe again whats another plot twist in the words of a champagnesoaked stephen strasburg celebrating the nationals securing a spot in the wild card game  why even play the game if youre not going to believe

take the time to appreciate how our washington nationals have handled the bryce harper situation,Nationals,184,ah6n9u,37,2019-01-18 07:17:15,it really is remarkable  thru the arbitration years they gave him a little more than he would have gotten if it went to hearing  then they didnt trade him when they had the opportunity before september  they offered him 10 years at 300 million  some even suggested that it wasnt a serious offer you sure about that  at 10 years300 million 30 million a year the nationals setup themselves up to receive no negative impact if bryce decides to go somewhere else concerns were that teams would drive up the price of harper the nationals are now able to offer slightly below other teams and save face they also allow bryce an out if the market isnt what he expected it to be  if right now the phillies offer 34 million a year the nationals can offer 32 hey harper you gonna leave dc everything you know and helped build for 2 million a year maybe but it makes him look like the mercenary the phillies offer 32 a year the nationals can stand at 30 or match   the phillies offer 36 37 40 a year sorry bryce and nationals fans but we gotta commit some money to the likes of rendon and other players   and if bryce finds that the market has indeed sold him short of the 400 or even 500 monster contract he can be the hero the good guy and take less to be where he loves   got to give it to the ownersmanagement on this one theyve set themselves up to not look bad at all no matter what happens and did attempt to allow bryce protection in the process  harper is willing to leave dc for a less than 10 better offer looks bad on harper not the nationals  harper leaves dc because a team drastically overpays for him the nationals hands arent bloody  harper can get 30 million a year and still look like the hero  tip of my cap to lerners  just my opinion  x200b

the nationals of tomorrow michael ayyyyy taylor,Nationals,156,axmgwi,38,2019-03-05 18:40:04,what would spring be without a bit of snow apparently and a heated discussion on michael taylor  i feel like more than any other player for some reason the haters flock to taylor i dont really care how good or bad taylor was in the past though because were here to talk about tomorrow  and as you may have heard the taylor or tomorrow has a new swing  before we get into the mechanics of his new swing though we should probably mention his success because taylor has crushed the ball so far in spring training as of monday morning hes a smooth 5836151083 in 12 at bats even better as of tuesday morning of course that is a insanely small sample and to extrapolate anything from it is impossible especially considering taylor at this point has become well known for destroying spring pitching  x200b  abavgobpslgbbso  201565323343646323 201653453491849728 201754315327500124 201831258303419638  last year was pretty much the first time in a full spring he struggled in general the fact that he has struggled or not doesnt really matter in the long run because in general there is no correlation between spring training stats and regular season stats a good spring taylor does not mean a good summer taylor  that doesnt mean that all spring stats are useless though certain statistics like bb and in particular so stabilize themselves in much fewer at bats for strikeouts that number is around 100 ab as we can see from the table above taylor never reached 100 at bats we can also see that his spring strikeout rate is anywhere from 2338 we often think of taylor as a high strikeout hitter and he largely is that  however in the upper minors he wasnt extremely so his strikeout rate never reached above 30 though it was close once in the minors and his walk rate was always well above average as well of course extra strikeouts were bound to popup once reaching the majors he hasnt been able to bring down those numbers close to the high 20s that he had in the minors though  why does taylor strikeout  might seem like a strange question because he swing and misses all the time obviously but why and what is he swinging and missing through lets look at two mystery players again a long with some of their 2018 stats  x200b  oswing zswing ocontact zcontact swstr  player a316736599760149 player b332733662844113  oswing is the percent of swings when the ball was out of the zone zswing is  of swings on balls in the zone the ozcontact are the percent of contact on those swings and swstr is the total percent of swinging strikes  x200b  in case you might have guessed player a is michael taylor he swings at a similar number of pitches in and out of the zone compared to player b however we can also see that compared to player b he is making a lot less contact especially on pitches inside the zone who is player b well it just so happens to be nolan arenado who you probably dont need me telling you is a damn good baseball player  why this seemingly random comparison primarily to point out how there are different ways to strike out taylor and arenado are swinging at a very similar number of pitches however taylor is making contact with them at a fraction of the rate arenado is the point being taylors strikeout problems are rooted largely in swing and miss as opposed to a poor eye  heres an easier way to see that among batters with at least 350 pa last year taylors zcontact of 760 would have placed him 7th only 6 players made less contact on balls in the zone then taylor did surprisingly his contact rate on pitches outside the zone is actually only the 61st worst out of 247 players which is helping to prop up his swstr to only the 21st worst  x200b  so what is the point taylor has a good eye but cannot consistently put the ball into play  solution shorten your swing to make more contact  and that is exactly what the nationals said they wanted to to with taylor this winter now if you look at the results down there it looks like his new swing was bad however more reports have surfaced recently to suggest that he was hurt twice during the winter and was just trying to see live pitching regardless of results  now that it is spring though we have seen taylor in action and we can see that the swing is indeed very very different  here is a video of taylor hitting a home run in 2018 courtesy of baseballsavant  here is a video of taylor hitting a home run this spring courtesy of mlb  unfortunately because the second video is from a different view im going to be comparing the 2018 swing to the swing he showed on 22719 since it was broadcast and has a the proper camera view  so lets get mechanical and take a look at taylors new swing  x200b  the leg kick  taylor used to have a pretty big leg kick  2018 leg kick  it was long it probably wasnt efficient there was a time when leg kicks were a huge part of the game it is far from dead but i dont think it is not as prominent as it once was a lot of that has to to do with a conscience effort to reduce moving parts while a kick can be a good timing mechanism for a lot of players ultimately its not helping you if it is slowing you down  here is what taylors leg kick looks like now  x200b  2019 leg kick  that is pretty much the extent of his leg kick now just a lift not even a tap the leg kick is probably the most obvious difference but the rest of his swing has become more compact with it  x200b  higher hands  in addition hes also moved where is hands sit preload  x200b  2018  x200b  2019  unfortunately the spring camera is a little more off center his hands have moved in two ways though up and inside this initial placement of his hands is maybe the most important change sometimes its hard for us to perceive how such a small change can make a big impact every single part of a players swing mechanics need to work in tandem though and something even like the initial placement of your hands will effect the rest of the swing a lot of this also involves what taylor did with his hands as he loaded  x200b  loading  this is where the real change is happening and its in part possible because of the two changes he made above here is michael taylor loading from last year  x200b  processing img cdes9gqwebk21  so much is happening in his load aside from the leg kick hes actively dropping his hands and pulling them back most players do this to an extent but taylor is swinging his arms everywhere hes making a loop with his arms as he coils himself to get ready i cant begin to express how much cleaner this looks this spring  x200b  processing img qthp49zlgbk21  his hands barely drop and he keeps them so much closer to his body just look how much stiller he is in the second gif compared to the first one his hands stay there too if you look at the home run video above from this spring you can see how still he keeps them once theyre loaded that was not the case in his swing from previous years where i really cant see any noticeable pause  x200b  will it work  i obviously dont know its worked pretty well this spring but as i mentioned earlier that of course is inconsequential  taylor was in need of a swing change though he has great power and speed weve always seen him flash that what he didnt have was an ability to make contact cleaning up your swing seems like a pretty sure fire way to get better  what is this really allowing him to do though is get his hands to the ball im fairly certain this concept is taught to just about every professional player long before they ever step foot in the minors the idea being that you dont swing the barrel towards the ball but rather the knob of the bat or your hands this seems counter intuitive but what this actually results in is the barrel hitting the ball  here is barry bonds swing stopped mid way though that is not a check swing that is a swing to deal damage we have a misconception in baseball that since a ball is a strike when it crosses the plate that over the plate is where hitters make contact that is also incorect even on outside pitches where the hitter wants to take the ball the other way often the ball never catches the plane of the plate this is much more pronounced on pull swings this puljols photo does a pretty good job of illustrating this  as i would like to point again and i hope ive illustrated this well every swing is different to say one thing works for one guy so it will work for everyone else just isnt correct that doesnt mean that every player already has the best swing they can harper has a pretty unique swing has it worked out for him overall for the most part yes would he be better suited to a more traditional swing we cant know unless he decides to try it for himself and why would you bother when youre already getting good results from what you have  taylor needed better results though and his swing was not conventional the swing we have seen this spring is much cleaner and typical if you will  taylor has always had quick hands his hands explode as he uncoils and this is a driving part behind his power there was so much coiling before though and his hands were moving so much that by the time they were in place he was already late on the pitch now his hands are not only starting closer to the plate but he also is doing a better job keeping them in hes standing straighter too and really straightening and pushing off of his back leg as he swings now  thats about all i got for now if you respond to something along the lines of taylor sucks meh ill just assume you didnt read anything since a i never said taylor was good b i never said taylor will now be good what i have here is a breakdown of the changes taylor made this year with the eye of improving himself next season if youre too dimwitted to understand that i dont know what to tell you

sanchezs start for the ages,Nationals,136,dh09ji,17,2019-10-13 00:14:38,usually i do analyses over at the minnesota twins sub but since they have been eliminated ive started branching out and doing analyses on more than just the twins and as a fan of baseball and a fan of good pitching i was naturally drawn to anibal sanchezs performance last night especially so because sanchez is not one of the stereotypical power pitchers that you see dominating todays game   it got me thinking about how he was able to dominate the cardinals last night i dove deeper and compared sanchezs 2019 regular season to sanchezs nlcs start this is what i got  anibal sanchez regular season vs nlcs    all velocity numbers look similar he may have had a little extra juice but at upper 80s to low 90s on average there is little to believe that he dominated with velocity to me what explains his dominance is the movement on his pitches on every pitch sanchez throws he benefited from more vertical or horizontal movement on some pitches he experienced more movement on both planes on the pitches he only experience more movement on one plane the other plane suffered little to no change while his ff fs and si didnt generate the swings and misses that he generally is accustomed to with them they did produce much more favorable outcomes weak contact as can be seen in xwoba  sanchezs ability to limit free bases and the ability to move the ball at a higher rate last night allowed him to give the nationals a crucial 10 lead in the nlcs with scherzer starting today and strasburgcorbin in their back pocket the nats have set themselves in the drivers seat

who the hell are these guys,Nationals,139,bjn15v,11,2019-05-02 01:53:07,you might have heard the nationals aaa team recently had to relocate itself a couple thousand miles away to fresno fresno is part of the pacific coast league the pacific coast league probably has baseballs most hitter friendly run environment the stadiums are in warm areas and many are at high elevation relative to most stadiums you can kind of imagine that the pcl is essentially made up of a lot of fields that play like coors field   so often when we see some incredible eye popping stats in the pcl its partially a product of the environment that player is playing in so really its more important in general to look at how that player is doing compared to his peers in the league  you may have missed it but the nationals actually as of 512019 feature 4 players in the top 15 in wrc wrc is an offensive statistic that tries to calculate a players overall offensive value a wrc of 100 means that player was league average a wrc of 120 means they were 20 better than league average a wrc of 80 means they were 20 below league average leading that pack is carter kieboom whos 185 wrc has him at 5th overall   right behind him though at 6th is yadiel hernandez yadiel was a cuban import the nationals signed in 2016 while he had been one of cubas better players he was already 28 when he signed and wouldnt appear in a minors game until 29 in 2017 the hope was he could be around an average mlb player who would come up through the minors quickly and maybe help of the bench this winter i guessed he might be one of the first callups in the event of an outfielder going down  now though hes trying to force his way onto the roster without an injury not only does he have a wrc of 183 hes walked 154 of the time while only striking out 143 of the time those two numbers alone are fantastic again these are pcl numbers however they are also almost identical to the walk and strikeout numbers he had in 129 at bats at harrisburg last year in which he had a wrc of 167 if one of the nationals outfielders goes down and needs a disabled stint it wouldnt surprise me to see them shift something to get him added to the 40 man hes now 31 years old and has shown he is ready to prove himself at the highest level  brandon snyder is 13 in wrc currently i could talk about him but there really isnt that much to say more than likely hes partly being propped by the pcl and his 5 walk rate and 23 strikeout rate attest to that instead were going to look at the national right below him  if youve never heard of jacob wilson before i dont blame you i had never heard of him and i like to keep pretty up to date on my nationals prospects at all levels part of this is a result of him being a cardinal farm hand prior to 2018 part of that is also because he had just never done that well that isnt to say he had been bad because he hadnt he had consistently been slightly above average last year he continued that and looked like the kind of guy who similarly to hernandez was destined to be on a mlb roster at some point but not for a long time   hes pretty much changed that whole concept in the span of 101 at bats his 109 walk rate is fantastic and the 139 strikeout rate even better hes combined that with 10 home runs  he hit 7 in over 450 at bats last year and a absurd 414 iso a metric that measure a players power its essentially slgavg he more impressive is hes slashing 310 despite a babip of 266 which means there is a chance he actually has been unlucky did i mention he plays 2b  its hard to know with a player like this just how legit his breakout is while the stats are impressive again this is his first go around in baseballs best hitting enviroment if i had written this post 10 days ago he would have been the top 5 with another wrc of over 180 so he hasnt been as hot lately as he was earlier in the season we can see though that some of the skills are probably legit his 139 k rate is the 20th lowest in the pcl of 128 qualified batters his babip is actually the 26th lowest too which is just insane given his insane slash line 310384724  before the start of this season i didnt even have wilson on my radar all of a sudden one month in and it wouldnt be crazy to think he debuts sometime this year  x200b  we have some interesting guys outside of our top prospects moving through the system right now just for fun heres how some of these guys are comparing to some of baseballs top prospects  x200b  playerbbkwrc  jacob wilson109139156 yadiel hernandez154143183 kyle tucker5824439 ian happ11727282 keston hiura43319139 brendan rogers105162136  x200b  the last thing to remember is that both of these guys hernandez and wilson are quite a bit older than the average pcl player age is a big factor in player success at various levels what juan soto did in the minors and majors last year would have been a lot less impressive if he was 25 not 19 wilson is already 28 and he is young compared to yadiels 31 with that said these guys are dominating the league age is helping them there but there clearly is a lot more going on here these are two guys which have quickly catapulted themselves to potentially being key pieces in this years race

hello darkness my old friend,Nationals,125,brqd75,12,2019-05-22 19:46:01,since last nights game made me think hello darkness my old friend i decided to do a parody song to the tune of the sounds of silence  hope you guys like it  hello darkness my old friend  here comes a pitching change again  i watched hooper leave on livestreaming  will we get bullpen help or just memeing  but whos the one that is picking up the ball  rosenthal  and now he has a virus  in rizzos dreams he walked alone  for seven million a new home  sans the doo our relief is grim  trevors bad but why blame just him  that he makes more than any manager makes me mad  who could we have had  our ceilings now 500  and on warmup mounds i saw  ten thousand dry humps maybe more  scherzer dealing without winning  hitters missing run support thinning  even the time traveler has scuffled at the plate  but i cant hate  the man is only twenty  and now take a look my bros  the il like a cancer grows  heal koda that we might see him  heal ryan that we might see zim  but my words like silent fastballs fell  and echoed in the hell of fourth place  and the people begged and prayed  a god of kimbrel they made  and the numbers made their warning  in the bullpen stats that were forming  and the stats said the bullpens pitches cannot be thrown by just one man  but davey thinks they can  and whispered in the sounds of dry humps  edit thanks everyone  the upvotes go up or down by two or three every reload but im not going to try to figure that out

regardless of your feelings about bryces move hats off to rizzo and the lerners,Nationals,118,avvzjp,121,2019-02-28 23:47:25,they gave bryce a very fair and generous offer right out of the gate it set the bar for his entire negotiation period and essentially made him set for life   as we know now money was definitely the driving factor behind his decision and he accepted a deal beyond what nats management felt was feasible for their planning nothing they could really do about it   bryce was a great national cant take away anything he did here but money talks and apparently any qualms he had about playing for a division rival were overshadowed by his payday cant blame him but in the end hell forever be linked to his new team identity in philly  the bottom line is that rizzo and the lerners went out and made some great moves to put together a really solid squad for this season im glad this free agency period is over and im fired up about focusing on spring training and the start of the season now guys like tony trea and soto can step up and shine on their own lets go

i hope rendon skips the allstar game its a great honor and im very appreciative he added but at the same time i play for the nationals and so i want to be at 100 percent or at least close to that and keep putting myself in position every day to actually help my team,Nationals,112,c8nvuo,19,2019-07-03 17:07:53,hes clearly dealing with some nagging injuries and could use four full days of rest  many players would go to the allstar game for personal glory at the expense of their team tony twobags seems to be leaning the other way and that could really matter down the stretch
running list of games the bullpen has blown,Nationals,106,bs2ulc,35,2019-05-23 17:19:00,definitely beating a dead horse at this point but here is a running list of the all the games in which i feel the bullpen has directly contributed to a loss for the nationals in some way whether giving up the losing run or not keeping the game close  this does not include any games where they tried to blow it but the bats saved them  it also does not include anytime a gassed starting pitcher was left in the game and gave up more runs due to lack of confidence in the bullpen  my point is this is not the extent of the negative contributions  just some of the ones that were the most infuriating     let me know if you guys feel like any others should be included    x200b  march 30th 118 l vs mets  nationals are tied 44 after the 6th  rosenthal grace and suero combine to give up 7 er in the 8th and 9th innings devastating as nats rally with 4 in the bottom of the 9th  x200b  april 6th 65 l vs mets nationals lead 53 going into the bottom of the 8th miller and sipp give up 3 er in the next inning  x200b  april 12th 63 l vs pirates  nationals lead 21 heading into the 8th sipp gives up 2 er but bats rally and take the game to extras  miller and grace proceed to give up 3 runs in the 10th  x200b  april 14th 43 l vs pirates  max goes 8 innings and has the nationals tied 33  suero gives up a run in the top of the 9th and nationals lose 43  x200b  april 26th 43 l vs padres  nationals are tied 22 after max leaves the game after 7 ip barraclough gives up a run in the top of the 8th and nationals tie it in the bottom of the 8th doolittle gives up the losing run in the top of the 9th   x200b  april 27th 63 l vs padres  combination of suero and miller gives up 6 runs in the top of the 10th nationals score what could have been the walk off in the bottom of the inning  x200b  may 3rd 42 l vs phillies  hellickson leaves after 51 ip and a 22 game  jennings comes in and gives up 2 er to finish the inning and earn the loss  x200b  may 5th 71 l vs phillies  nationals trail 21  anibal sanchez leaves i think with an injury after 42 innings and 0 er  grace comes in and an inning later gives up 5 er in the bottom of the 6th  x200b  may 6th 53 l vs brewers  nationals lead 32 after an eaton hr in the top of the 7th  jennings and suero each give up an er in the bottom of the inning  x200b  may 17th 146 l vs cubs  nationals trail 54 after 7  miller barraclough jennings and grace give up 9 er of the next two innings  a real group effort  x200b  may 21st 65 l vs mets  nationals lead 31 going into the bottom of the 7th  suero gives up 3 run hr  nationals retake the lead 54 rainey gives up 2 er over the next two innings and mets walk it off  x200b  may 22 61 l vs mets  max wins duel with degrom and hands a 10 lead over to the bullpen which proceeds to give up 6 er in the 8th  x200b  so by my count thats a minimum of around 40 of our losses that the bullpen is responsible for one thing worth nothing is that 5 of these were scherzer starts i understand we cant expect the bullpen to be perfect all the time and i know this is not the only serious issue with the team but still even if they only blow half of the games i mentioned above thats still 6 additional wins which would give us a 2524 record and wed still have some hope i know weve typically not had a great bullpen but this has seriously been some next level shit   may 23 64 l vs mets  nationals lead 43 going into bottom of the 8th suero gives up 3 run hr to carlos gomez

im really starting to believe this is the end for the nationals,Nationals,111,c2huxm,42,2019-06-19 18:36:56,i woke up this morning thinking about the current state of our bullpen and as we all know they just havent been pitching lately i could probably write up a 12page research paper as to why this may be and where the problem really lies but personally i dont think we can blame davey or even rizzo from what i can tell the situation is out of everyones hands and theres nothing management can really do      along with the bullpen i think everyone can agree that much of our infield hasnt been showing up to play either i havent seen anything out of trea howie kendrick or even rendon lately i mean what the hell is going on these guys are supposed to be some of our best players but ive been turning on the tv and immediately getting disappointed because it feels like their hearts just arent in it and the same goes for most of our pitchers in fact it feels like their bodies just arent in it either      in the end i think its important to remember that this isnt anyones fault dont blame davey or rizzo for the fact that the bullpen just hasnt been pitching lately and the infield hasnt been showing up to play blame the rain im getting real sick and tired of this garbage ass weather i just want to see the boys play again

reasons why im not renewing my sth this year,Nationals,103,chbxdu,84,2019-07-24 22:24:32,as requested by ublondefox18 and ugeneticlyperfct in this thread ive made a list of some of the reasons im not renewing my season tickets after this season  some background  ive been a half season 40 game sth since 2006  started with tix in the lower bowl at rfk moved to nats park to lower bowl 3rd base side then moved to 1st base side and most recently moved up to the 300 level  fair warning  this could turn into a rant  lack of sth benefits   back in the day you could cash in rcr points for seats in the presidentslexus club  we were able to get enough to do this once a year  benefit removed   red carpet rewards was expanded to include everyone not just sth  benefit removed   no more sth 15 discount in the team store with nats plus card  only way to get the discount now is to use ecash which they keep if you dont spend it all  benefit removed   no more 1 for 1 ticket tradein  now its based on the face value of the ticket  i can no longer trade two wednesday marlins tickets for 2 saturday cubs tickets  i understand why they made this change but it was still an sth benefit  sobenefit removed   the subject of the original post  no sth gift  it seems like they werent going to give one at all then people bitched and they said they would but it hasnt come yet  they just want people to forget about it  benefit removed   when they moved to the cards and later the ticket app there were no more physical tickets to keep from special games  this allowed them to money grab by offering the option to buy a commemorative ticket but i dont think they even do that anymore   tickets and pricing   tickets have almost no value on resale  im not expecting to make a profit if i miss a game but list prices on stubhub for my section range from 6 to 20  and thats if they even sell which is about 5050   tickets are plentiful on stubhub for nearly every game  this is the flip side from above  what sense does it make to pay 30 in advance for tickets when i can go on stubhub and get seats in the same general area for as low as 6  this might be a problem if the stadium ever starts to sell out regularly but its been 15 years and it hasnt happened yet   even though i didnt get physical tickets anymore i liked the nats plus cards and the online ticket transfer system  the new ballpark app is a step down in my opinion and makes sharing tickets with a season plan group much more difficult   account reps   ive had at least 5 account reps in the last 5 years  i get that its probably a crappy job but can they keep anybody   the only time i hear from my rep is when i get a new one  no check in calls once a season really no effort to establish any relationship   in my experience its rare that my account rep returns a voicemail  i have to keep calling until they pick up the phone  your mileage may vary and they are a bit better with email responses  other   i could end up being proven wrong but it seems theyve completely shit the bed on resigning rendon  i was ok with harper leaving because i never really liked him and dont think he was worth the money he was going to cost  but if they cant keep rendon then i have to wonder if this organization deserves my money   concessions  theyre just awful  theyre incapable of handling a crowd of more than 25000  i cant go get anything because i miss 2 innings of the game  the workers are surly and slow  half the time there are 8 workers and only one open register  i dont know what the rest of them are doing  the problems are obvious if you care enough to look which i dont think they do    its like nobody from management has ever walked the 300 level concourse during a saturday game against the dodgers  i bet the suite and club level service is great though    so it turns out there arent 1400 reasons im not renewing as promised in the other thread but these are the ones that i came up with after about 5 minutes of thought before i wrote this post  hope it wasnt too ranty  edit  messed up the list formatting  hopefully its more readable now

joe ross could be the hero this bullpen needs,Nationals,94,bicfvn,12,2019-04-28 19:34:31,im gonna talk about joe ross again i talked about him during spring training but why not talk about him again because who doesnt like some joe ross  ross has been warmed up on a few occasions but for various reasons has often missed appearing in games so far since his april 7th call up part of that is davey has seemed reluctant to put ross in high leverage situations since his shaky debut  heres the thing though his debut was a couple pitches way from being pretty good despite a few pitches that were no were close he was doing a good job of pounding the zone but had some key strikes called balls inside joe ross also threw one changeup that outing can you guess which one it is a 3 run home run on that center cut changeup ended his night  in the post i wrote back in march i talked about how joe ross needed to develop a third pitch to be effective as a starter i wasnt sure if the changeup was that pitch though i imagine the nationals agree as hes thrown just 3 more changeups in the subsequent 51 innings and the locations again were all far from ideall as a reliever though ross current lack of an effective third pitch is less pronounced given that he goes out for shorter stints  something interesting has changed in joes pitch profile though aside from bumping his slider usage back to 30  in my other post full of conviction in all caps i proclaimed  joe ross should not be throwing a four seam fastball ever and then as if to mock me he goes and raises last years high of 31 to 49 this year ross had almost never used a 4seam fastball before 2018s end of year stint his fastball had been a sinker and statcast believes he didnt throw a single four seamer until 2017  in both of those small samples though his fastball had been crushed while his sinker looked average this year that hasnt happened were still at the point where this seasons samples for relievers are laughably small theres very little we can really see other then maybe velocity spikes the velocity on all his pitches is up if you were wondering and maybe a little pitch mix  however joe ross 4 seam fastball is inducing wiffs so we need to talk about it if you hadnt heard strikeouts are one of the strongest indicators of pitcher success you also may be unaware that one of the strongest indicators for high strikeouts is a pitcher who can induce a lot of swinging strikes  so far hes had 9 swing and misses on the 46 4 seam fastballs hes thrown last year he had 2 swinging strikes on 79 of them on 142 sinker plus 4 seams last year he had 8 swinging strikes total so he has literally already passed his total from last year in almost a quarter of the time thats a big deal because last year all of a sudden ross strikeouts dissipated his slider wasnt getting the same misses it used to and his 4 seamer wasnt working  which is why its so crazy that suddenly it is its also no immediately clear why its about 1 mph faster now at 94 mph but is that a big enough jump the spin rate is up but its still below the major league average  you might remember in that other piece how i talked about the similarity between ross two fastballs movement release point and velocity wise they were all very similar so much so that fangraphs and baseball savant were flip flopped between 20162017 on which years he wasnt using a sinker exclusively so heres the vertical and horizontal movement from 2016  x200b  2016 joe ross vertical vs horizontal movement  what you notice is that the changeup and the two fastballs are more or less just all mushed on top of each other its one of the reasons his changeup is probably as bad as it is because its basically just a slower fastball  through these very short 52 innings this year though this is how that same graph looks  x200b  2019 joe ross vertical vs horizontal movement  its almost likes theres a little imaginary line separating these two pitches now instead of a conglomerate of pitches we suddenly have two tidy groups maybe this is early season noise and before long the cluster will return but right now it looks like joe ross might have finally done something to separate his fastballs this change in movement is fairly subtle his sinker has moved a tick or two to the left and his 4 seam has moved a tick or two to the right more than anything itw what is good about it is that it is showing consistency  x200b  joe ross has shown that he has the tools to be successful the swinging strikes on his fastball have been up in the zone while the hard contact has been down if he can start locating all three of his pitches fastball up sinker downinside and slider downout of the zone this could be what he needed right now the stat line isnt pretty but he has pitched better than it says since that first outing which again was a couple pitches away from being good hes given up three hits and walked one the hit last night really should be an error by howie kendrick in case you missed it that was also joe ross fastest slider of his career  x200b  processing img zdsqvdn4v0v21  its been a tick up the past two outings and its had a hair more spin as well interestingly the spin has also been a little more inconsistent in that time which once again brings me back to this post by jeff sulivanrip i dont think thats whats happening here necessarily simply its possible ross is tinkering with it a bit and lucky for him he might have someone who could help him tinker it quite a bit  joe ross had one of his first high relief innings this year since his call back up he picked up his defense and pitched a scoreless inning the late innings have been forced up guys like suero and grace because the other options werent any better joe ross doesnt even need to stick his foot int he door he should be ready to walk through what at this point has to be a wide open door for late innings barraclough is not the guy the tiny era isnt masking his 6 bb9 and the fact hes let 7 of 8 inherited runners score the nationals need someone to grab onto the job and at this point its hard to see who else on the mlb roster right now can do that  x200b  on an aside dont be surprised if we see austin adams back up sometime in may his poor inning in the majors this year aside hes dominating in the pcl 8ip 15k 2bb 2h which is notoriously the most hitter friendly environment in the minors the walk has always been holding him back but theres a chance this is the year he finally harness the stuff

could the nationals bullpen be the worst of all time how good would we be with an average bullpen all this and a little bit more,Nationals,92,bwelux,23,2019-06-03 23:10:37,hey there today is an offday and i spent part of it talking nats with some friends and decided to play with some numbers instead of doing my actual job  nbsp  how bad is our bullpen compared to the worst ever  a fun question with a decidedly not fun answer almost from what i can find the worst bullpen belonged to the 1950 athletics who owned a collective era of 777 through 172 and 23 innings in a year where they went 52102 thats pretty bad  nbsp  so how bad is ours through 175 and 23 innings remember starters used to throw  1 trillion innings in their lives our collective bullpen era is 681 good for what would be the 5thworst bullpen era ever    nbsp  but thats not nearly as bad as i expected you might be saying to yourself good point so  nbsp  how bad is our bullpen compared to the worst ever if we took out sean doolittle  now were talking removing seans contributions to the team our collective era would be 744 good for a very close 2nd to the worst all time pretty gross  nbsp  but so what  nbsp  how good would our team be if we just had a leagueaverage bullpen  using bill james pythag expected wl formula and dropping our runs allowed assuming we had a bullpen era of 440 our expected wins would be 32   nbsp  for reference we currently have 26 wins now so thats6 more than we have instead of a 441 winning rate we would have a 517 click things arent so dark maybe  nbsp  tldr  our bullpen could go down as one of the worst ever but we have sean so things arent as bad as they could be and theres reason to be optimistic about pulling ourselves up over the long haul if our bullpen stopped being so bad

british fan looking for information,Nationals,69,c7ktoj,41,2019-07-01 02:56:05,hey guys recently got into mlb the show and have fallen in love with my franchise mode with the nationals so i decided to start following them in real life too what are some things i should know about them

has martinez reached the firing point,Nationals,70,bro6mm,80,2019-05-22 16:28:46,i know the popular answer is a kneejerk yes but read on anyway please  x200b  so as i view it a mlb manager has three roles  x200b  1 knowing which fundamentals to reinforce 2 keeping the players focused 3 putting the players in a position to succeed  x200b  to take these points up with martinez  x200b  1 he seems like the sort of manager that thinks fundamentals are a waste of time because he hated working them as a player probably because his managerscoaches used them as punishment the players should already know this stuff mentality weve seen a marked decline in fundamental execution this season and i think the reason is that the mindset martinez projects is one where fundamentals arent important  x200b  2 his positive attitude approach seems to be a copout in this area his job right now is to take the heat off the team and put it on him well actually that was his job 20 games ago  the heat is now on him however this team is playing tight like theyre thinking about the issues theyre in while theyre on the field this is a direct management issue  hes being the equivalent of the guy in corporate america who says keep working and things will get better while having no actual direction defined that will make things improve hes a cheerleader rather than a leader  x200b  3 he flatout sucks at this especially with bullpen pitchers if your kid in his second majorleague game walks a guy in a highleverage situation during his second inning after having pitched the night before you pull him he blew this twice last night  and has blown this over and over again sometimes i dont think hes paying attention to how the pitchers get there  and sometimes i think he thinks every pitcher is scherzer sueros second inning looked flatout bad right from the beginning new tanners second inning looked better at first but i dont know how you justify sending him out there for a second inning in that situation  to give another example sipps splits all year showed him being much better against righties than lefties however martinez kept putting him in against lefties because apparently hes left handed and thats what baseball says you should do i think you can go too far with analytics but this is exactly the kind of data that can make a bad bullpen mediocre and mediocre would be enough with this team  he has managed this team out of contention  being 10 games under in april is one thing but its end of may some things are out of his control but the these three items are in his control and hes failed at all three of them

find critical violations at nfl nhl nba mlb stadiums  2018 the other day lets ignore the fact that it says 2018 in the title when its getting its data from 20162017 it lists nationals park as the 6th highest offender in mlb 27th in all professional sports now i have no need to defend nats park but i had a hunch this was some overblown bullshit thrown together as lightly researched clickbait so i decided to look into the 2018 data   dc lists all health inspection reports online and are available to browse at this link from there ive gathered all the data based upon the inspection done april 3 2018 2 days before the nats home opener except 2 locations which were listed as having a complaint ive noted those theres data from 22 different standssections and ive tried to identify them as best as possible in all theres 84 total violations i havent broken them down by severity because im not really familiar with that this all sounds bad until you look at the data  locationviolationsdetails

apparently didnt have the proper chemicals for cleaning up vomit before the season sounds iffy that something like this would be needed but no stands had it so maybe its possible the standards for what is and isnt the proper cleaning solution changed since the last inspection idk but lets say you dont really care about that as it doesnt affect food going into your face when you take out just the vomit cleaner violations youre left with 63 violations of varying severity  all in all i still feel ok about the unhealthy amounts of food i shove in my face at nats park every day nothing on this list is really going to make me think twice about any of it its not like they found deep fried rats or anything thank you for coming to my ted talk

appreciating the nats game day experience,Nationals,64,abbr23,34,2019-01-01 01:01:44,so ive been talking with my friends recently about the demise of the redskins and one of the topics that comes up frequently is that setting aside the dysfunction of the team and the front office the game day experience is such a joke as to be nonexistent      we began comparing it to going to a nats game and it really made me appreciate the game day experience that ive begun to take for granted at nats park especially in the last few years as half st has started to really build up      but for redskins you start at nearly double the ticket price and immediately you face the choice of showing up at 8am to get tailgating spot or showing up closer to gameday and risking the insane traffic entering the stadium if you do chose the tailgating option you have no options to go someplace close for fooddrinks because everything is at least a mile walk away from the stadium entrance so youve got no choice but to sit and drink in a gray parking lot for 6 hours and hope youre soberexited enough still at game time like its the worst campground ever then you can watch the redskins keep themselves just in the game enough in the 1st half that you stick around through no halftime entertainment only to have your will to live sucked out of you watching the 2nd half redskins and then you get to sit in at least 15 hours of traffic as you exit the stadium      my typical nats gameday by contrast goes something like this i take off work early at like 4ish and hop on the college park metro right near my work get off at waterfront and walk to go get some decent dinner love bluejacket but also love takorean and big stick if bj is too crowded head over to the bullpen where i can watch some live music and crush a few beers then walk literally 1000 feet down half street and im in the park all for half the cost of a redskins ticket      who in their right mind is actually going to these football games and more importantly great job nats stadium on not following suit

projected starters for the nlcs,Nationals,16,dfzdr0,3,2019-10-10 19:09:32,i put together this table showing what i think are the most likely starts for the rotation against st louis im assuming that scherzer will be okay to start this saturday on 5 days of rest which means each of the top 3 starts twice if it goes to 7 games and sanchez starts game 4 i put corbin with 5 days of rest for friday even though he pitched last night because that was only 22 pitches and his outing on the 6th was only 35 so he should be good to go  if scherzer is not okay to start on saturday because hes so gassed from monday then we end up with sanchez starting twice and either stras or scherzer only gets 1 start or both stras and scherzer would start games 6 and 7 on 4 days rest which seems like a bad idea given that we get there only if scherzer needs extra rest  ive also highlighted the bullpen session days for the starters because given how we used them in the nlds it looks like they are probably good for 1525 pitches on those days without blowing up their schedule note that scherzer gets these for games 4 and 5 because of the off day before his start on game 6   game 1game 2off daygame 3game 4game 5off daygame 6game 7  startercorbinscherzer strasburgsanchezcorbin scherzerstrasburg scherzer rest451234561 stras rest234512345 corbin rest512345123 sanchez rest567891234   anyway obviously this is all speculative and who actually starts is hugely dependent on the outcomes of the games and so forth but i thought it would be useful to see how everyone is lined up coming out of the nlds
whats this win mean to you,Nationals,56,dfu9ba,17,2019-10-10 11:01:20,i imagine most nats fans are asleep on the east coast but im looking to see what this win means to nats fans   i grew up in northern virginia and the orioles never felt like my team maybe it was because we didnt pay more for hts so we only got friday night games of the os on upn i think but i never connected with anyone other than the greatness of cal ripken  then i went to college in upstate ny in 04 instantly surrounded by yankees and red sox fans the red sox came back from 03 and i remember feeling a desire to be a part of that not that rivalry but that feeling of the tension of playoff baseball   then the longrumored hope became a reality my hometown would finally have a baseball team i wasnt wild about the name i remember actively planning out how i would fit researching about all the players on the nats around my college studies i bought the mlbtv package and i watched that first game against the phillies   what a start i vividly remember the washington post headline when they won 10 straight junes end as hot as july college kids could get in for 5 on wednesdays i went to one game a series i once drove my car to a specific spot in a parking lot because thats just where the am signal came in best i listened to a game because back then only the weekend games were put on tv   i loved them through the losing my parents moved to upstate new york and while my dad was still in virginia i was missing him on fathers day who hit a game winning home run on that day ryan zimmerman  in 2008 they got a new ballpark all i wanted for christmas was seats to the first game and to go with my dad we sat in section 403 row f and saw zimmerman hit another walk off ill never forget highfiving people while walking down the ramp screaming 10  i went to the introductory press conference in august 2009 when they signed stephen strasburg i drove up to syracuse to see his last aaa start his first start was the first time it felt like winning was possible  i got way to excited about going 500 in 11 im still annoyed they didnt get to play game 162 so it could have happened   i left a bar early to see bryces first game in 12 against the dodgers few months later i met my now wife she saw me really early at my worst after they blew a 60 lead versus st louis i think drew storen is unfairly scapegoated and am annoyed no one ever mentions edwin jackson  clippard gave up runs as well   completely missed a wedding for the 18 inning game vs sf   went to la for game 3 in 16   i moved to portland its a great place for me to live but i miss going to nats games i maybe make two a year but this win it reminded me whats so great about sports the nats remind me of where i grew up connect me to childhood friends have strengthened relationships but whether its hearing charlie slowes saying bang zoom or the childlike memories of walking down the ramp in rfk this whole experience has brought me a lot of joy  hopefully they keep winning     what do the nationals mean to you

what are your thoughts on corbin coming out of the pen for game 5 what about sanchez,Nationals,7,df3oax,28,2019-10-08 22:01:32,assuming hes rested enough  its no secret that corbin has looked a tad shaky this series in game 1 he looked lights out but had a brutal first inning with 4 walks he got his act together quickly and the slider worked magic when he came in to relieve in game 3 the slider didnt have the same magic and the dodgers got some quality hits  i want suero strickland and rodney nowhere near this game personally but corbin is a gamble too if the dodgers dont bite on the low and outside slider like they did in game 1   so if not corbin would you want to see sanchez come in his junk is just what we need against the dodgers as they love to crank the fastball whatever happens in game 5 davey has his work cut out for him in terms of bullpen management

i would like to keep this season in a bottle,Nationals,54,dcyxol,3,2019-10-04 03:13:40,ive never had this much fun following a team or baseball in general through a season i got to follow some great teams and players as a kid growing up watching the relatively hometown ripken hit 2131 the home run chase when all my teachers were updating chalkboards with mcgwire and sosas numbers my grandmother and mom grew up in cleveland and i spent a lot of time chatting with my grandmother about that stacked 90s indians team other relatives in georgia and following maddux who became my favorite pitcher and the source of my only piece of signed memorabilia being so happy finally getting a team in the nationals that actually felt like mine not borrowed from somewhere else        nothings been like this season yeah there were the early doldrums but ever since the may turnaround everythings felt so fresh and exciting they could come back at any time any lead for both teams isnt a sure thing the boys look like theyre having so much fun the lineup feels so stacked like teams would grab our bench players or the bottom of our lineup and shove them somewhere in their 15 the wc win felt like a world series win to cap off a glorious season id like to see them go as far as they can but im already happy with everything i just hope i get to experience a season like this again and its not even over        a bunch of grown men flashing baby shark signs after hits dancing in the dugouts long tender hugs marching from 1931 to 9369 wc winning hit by a shufflestepping 20yearold sophomore that needs to continually adjust his cup to reign in his tremendous balls making sure teams are now 2741 when entering the 9th with a 6 run lead        how can you not be romantic about baseball

so about that play 2 questions,Nationals,22,dcchca,22,2019-10-02 20:19:27,i was at the game but obviously it was an intense moment  my memory is kinda blurry and the tbs broadcast never showed a camera angle that focuses on the baserunners  1 am i wrong that tony stopped at 3rd and almost didnt score  to me it looked like he didnt see the misplay and at least initially stopped at 3rd  2 why did soto get hung up  was it just an understandable overexcited brain fart  or was he trying to draw the play away from home  that said him dancing between 2nd and 3rd and not giving a crap is my favorite part  is there another camera angle where you can see the bases  thanks
nlds nats at dodgers,Nationals,12,dce5p6,35,2019-10-02 22:22:17,what are your thoughts on how we match up with the dodgers and will the nats use last night to win their first postseason series and go on a ws run  i think we match up better than some in the media give us credit for  both teams have really good offenses and insane lights out pitching la has been really good this year and theyre probably gonna be the favorites but theres a reason you play the games  if all that mattered was team record on paper  the dodgers wouldve won the ws by now  theyre really good but its not like the season series against them was one sided with our pitching i think we match up really well against them and the lineup is due to get hot again i think theres something about a postseason series that makes you relax knowing you have at least three games and its not win or go home like last night  all the experts will probably assume the dodgers will advance and wipe us out but i think our lineups match up well and we have a good chance to win the nlds for the first time i think that win last night has the potential to propel this team to the ws   where this gets hard is if we win the first game and lose the second who pitches the third game im assuming itll be corbin game 1 s nchez game 2 stras game 3 scherzer game 4 and corbin game 5 i know max will find his form at some point but until he can show hes back i would prefer to use him only after stras to give us the best chance to win
both corbin and sanchez should pitch tonight,Nationals,0,dcq7cv,21,2019-10-03 16:29:38,corbin is starting obviously but if the team has a narrow lead or is losing by a small amount sanchez should be put in much like strasburg was last game who cares if we blow 2 starting pitchers in the first game if we win then its worth it if we lose then we lose the game its a gamble but its a better gamble than using the bullpen

nl wild card predictions and preview,Nationals,5,dbdryd,44,2019-09-30 20:06:01,what are your predictions for tomorrow night who wins what the score is who has the big hit how do you think we match up against the brewers going into tomorrow night and who do you think has the advantage  key for me is can max get through the first couple innings without giving up any runs or at most one or two runs im hoping this will be the start max really locks everything back in and that he can go 7 or 8 innings which would help us a lot and then have hudson close out the game offensively the brewers have several injuries and the nats are on fire scoring at home and the stadium being packed should definitely help  brewers have had a few tough losses and that could weigh on them knowing tomorrow is an elimination game whereas the nats have been playing out of their minds for months  none of us are asking for max to have a no hitter although that would be cool to see but just to keep the team in the game and give them the best chance to win like he did almost every night before he got injured hes probably known for over a week that he was going to be starting this game so hopefully he gives up one or only a couple runs at most

predict our wc opponents starter,Nationals,6,dawimt,4,2019-09-29 19:22:07,obviously there are still a lot of variables at play we could still face either the cards or the brewers and if its the brewers it could be with or without an off day for them tomorrow  about the only starters we can rule out are todays starters barring an absolutely wild result eg cards get up big early and pull flaherty after just an inning or two thinking they can save his arm only to end up blowing it anyway  so who do you guys expect to see on tuesday if  1 we face the brewers with no game 163 tomorrow  2 we face the brewers and they play 163 tomorrow  3 we face the cards which can only happen with a game 163 tomorrow
national league wild card game ticketsparkinglogisticsquestions including ticket trading megathread,Nationals,51,dandv8,195,2019-09-29 03:16:32,this thread is to centralize discussion and questions related to attending tuesday nights wild card game this includes general questions and all ticket and parking sales and trades which may be included in the comments other posts relating to these topics may be removed   schedule   the game will be at 808 pm tuesday night october 1 on tbs  mlb postseason schedule  tickets   nationals postseason information   direct link to purchase wild card game tickets   standing room only tickets are now on sale for those who have been asking but are not much cheaper than the cheapest seats still available    there are no 5 grandstand tickets for postseason games sorry dont wait out for them    if you have a paper ticket strip the ticket for this one should be easy to find it is at the bottom right of the full strip  the only one with a red background it says national league wild card    electronic tickets should also generally be available in the ballpark app and can be transferred via your account    parking and transportation   metro metro has announced it will keep running at least 20 minutes after the end of the game so long as it isnt more than an hour past the regular closing      regularly scheduled last trains are at 1122 pm to greenbelt most connections and 1148 pm to branch avenue from navy yard so you have at least until an hour past that but i cant imagine theyd leave everyone if the game isnt over by then after issuing this press release    last time there were some selfhelp efforts by nats fans to arrange carpooling in to the park area in light of the parking and metro situation if anyone is organized enough to start a thread on that feel free and i will link it directly here    the team parking lots appear to be sold out but if any spots are released they would likely appear here   parking has recently been very tight for postseason games and expensive on the secondary market i highly recommend knowing exactly where you are going to park in advance if you are planning to drive a few private lot spaces at reasonable prices are still available   parking panda    parkwhiz  no endorsement of any particular lots  logistics   bag policy no backpacks    gates open at 530    ecash the information sent to sth says ecash will be accepted in the postseason but there will be no ecash back discount plan accordingly   go nats

who should really start the wildcard game,Nationals,41,d93v6d,63,2019-09-25 18:14:05,serious discussion here  obviously max is lined up to pitch the game and he is our ace and one of the greatest pitchers of all time but the numbers speak for themself since returning from injury max has an era hovering around 5 most of those starts are very recent september  meanwhile stras has a 200 era 165 opponent ba in september facing 34 playoff teams and his career postseason era is sub1 small sample size but still a few games pitched   also corbin has a 248 era 217 opponent ba in september facing 35 playoff teams and the phillies who have a winning record   obviously things depend on who lines up to be available for october 1st but id like to know your thoughts both regardless of that and while taking that into account personally im conflicted  i love how stras has been pitching in september against playoff teams and his postseason numbers are insane 047 era in 19 ip but weve all seen him struggle in the first inning  have starts where he gets beat up early and that terrifies me  thoughts

wild card game lineup,Nationals,4,d98wps,13,2019-09-26 00:15:48,weve talked a lot about who should and who will start the wc game now id like to ask your opinion on how our batting lineup will look like  top of the order turnereatonrendonsoto is a nobrainer as are the spots 79 roblesgomespitcher the real question is who will play first  second base and bat 5th 6th  our options   brian dozier 233 ba 758 ops in 473 pa  howie kendrick 344 ba 963 ops in 362 pa  matt adams 226 ba 750 ops in 324 pa  ryan zimmerman 253 pa 736 ops 180 pa  asdrubal cabrera 304 ba 905 ops in 133 pa   over the last 10 games davey has went with   asscab  adams  zim  dozier  kendrick  asscab x4  kendrick  dozier x2  asscab  zim x2  in my opinion the stats speak for themselves kendrick has been one of our top hitter all season and cabrera has also shined in his limited time here they should get the start however i have a terrible feeling that davey will pull a dusty on us and start dozier started most of the season he was the one who got us here andor zimmerman clubhouseleading veteran hes the starter when healthy etc what are your thoughts

in search of a harrisburg senators ice cream helmet,Nationals,34,d401tg,2,2019-09-14 07:28:59,xpost from rharrisburg as suggested  hey strange question i know but heres the backstory my 4yearold and i have been grieving the loss of my father since march this year and decided to honor his memory and try to heal by going to as many baseball games as we could this year when i had days off dad was a big fan and i have many fond memories of him taking me to our local aa team when i was little our beloved pnats have packed up and moved away at the end of this season so to soften the blow of that as well we have taken some road trips to visit a bunch of other ballparks its been really good for healing for both of us as part of this my son has fallen in love with the tradition of getting an ice cream helmet at the games  we managed to catch the last game of the harrisburg senators playoff run the other day and saw some potomac nats alumni but unfortunately they didnt have any more senators helmets and may have even stopped making them before this year according to the fan services desk but ive been told they did exist at one time recently these days they only use the mlb nationals helmets which he already has several of my son was disappointed but soldiered on through it cracker jacks and a promise to ride that little train around the island after the game helped and i thought it might be worth taking a long shot to see if i could find him one after the fact do any of you out here on reddit happen to have one stashed away that you arent using that i could buy for him  thanks and sorry for the intrusion i hope its ok to post this here but if not my apologies

fans of the former senators teams how do you feel about seeing them in their current forms,Nationals,8,d3rtry,4,2019-09-13 20:33:35,as i said in the postgame thread playing the twins almost feels like seeing an old ex because while you two split up a long time ago and the hurts mostly subsided you still know what you two used to be and you get a weird feeling in your gut but i say that as someone born well after both washington based american league teams left town i sort of carried the hurt with my father who loved both teams but was especially devastated when the expansion senators left for texas told me he couldnt bear to listen to the game on the radio or go to the stadium that night   i dunno how many of you were fans of the old team or are close to a fan of the old teams but if you are does this ever cross your mind

who would you mostleast like to face in a wild card game,Nationals,19,d1yn13,16,2019-09-10 02:56:03,lets say the nats stay in their current position and play in the wild card game who would you mostleast like to face  cubs the cubs of course have those ridiculous homeroad splits so it would be advisable to host the game although the nats obviously had no problem playing them on the road their last series the javier baez injury is something to watch out for not sure who their best starter is  kyle hendricks yu darvish  diamondbacks  the sneks have been blistering lately ketel marte sneakily has been the best 3b in the nl west this year with a season arguably as good as rendon if they hadnt traded away greinke id be petrified to play them as it is now im assuming nats legend robbie ray would be their ideal wc starter  brewers  this is a team thats basically getting carried by yelich their vaunted bullpen from last year hasnt really been as good chacin was recently dfad aguilar has been bad assume they would like to start woodruff maybe davies  phillies  we know about this team they would definitely want to start nola because otherwise oof  mets  thankfully the mets are four back and seemingly remain dysfunctional because this team is scary when you catch them on a good day basically every time the nats have played them this year apparently degrom occasionally pitches well

2 questions about extra postseason strips,Nationals,2,d1fnji,5,2019-09-08 23:31:34,the nationals website is incredibly vague about 2 policies re buying extra postseason strips for friends im unable to reach the sth office thought i would check here  1 can we resell individual games on extra strips on stubhub in the past this was possible but ive heard some teams have started to prevent this   2 will they directly refund us minus sh fees the unplayed games on an extra strip on the site they said theyll credit our account to our 2020 season payment but that doesnt make sense for the extra ticket strips since they cost more and my next season would already be paid for by the unplayed games in my personal strip

why are fans not showing up what would help,Nationals,21,czoo7z,48,2019-09-04 22:21:24,i used to work in dc for 2 years where i tried to go to nats park as often as possible i moved to arizona 4 years ago so im a little out of the loop as to what ticket prices parking prices placement and food prices are like im interested to hear what fans actually think and why maybe they dont show up as much i think nats fans are actually incredibly loyal  my likely outdated thoughts   weekday games before 5pm are hard to go to if you work in dc   if you live outside of dc its hard to make it to game until the weekend   commuting into dc was horrible so i can only imagine its worse now   need more sales to fill the seats vs calls to action that kinda seem to try to guilt fans   no backpack this is a new rule i think can make things challenging when youre going to a game after work   food prices are pretty high i havent been to the park in 4 years but i remember good beer was like 812 dollars   metro stop has been broken i dont miss dc metro but i think it was a huge source to getting to the park so if its down or delayed in general people may not want to deal with it    people mentioned ticket prices aside from the ones behind home plate i feel like tickets are actually pretty affordable  am i out of touch in thinking that   x200b  edit additional thoughts  things ive heard   ive heard people say that losing harper pissed fans off but i dont really think thats as longlasting as they make it seem no offense to harper but he isnt having that great a season with the phillies and personally i find soto more exciting to watch and grow and id honestly be much more upset if we were to lose rendon   people also mentioned the all star game being hosted in dc interested to hear what that was like for fans and people working commuting in the city did that cause fatigue

howie kendrick,Nationals,7,czl8yl,4,2019-09-04 17:59:30,i may not have all the information so thats why im asking im confused as to why kendrick is not in the starting lineup more often at quick glance of his numbers hes got a high average good power and limits the strikeouts seems like hes able to play multiple positions as well i just feel like parra is better served to be the pinch hittingdefensive replacement type of player yet hes in the lineup every day is there a nagging injury for kendrick thats keeping him on bench duty any insight would be appreciated no hate at all just a tad confused

playoff ticket prices,Nationals,10,czevbb,9,2019-09-04 06:36:33,hello all i find myself being in dc for the first time on oct 13 i was wondering how much playoff tickets usually cost at nats park assuming they play a wild card game there or a nlds match up  ive been a nats fan since 08 lived 15 minutes away from citi field went to every single game from 20102015 at citi field when the nats were thereit helps that i had free tickets for all the games besides when the nationals were thereand got into the all star game and homerun derby by walking in  ive always wanted to watch a game in dc as ive also seen them play in yankee stadium and atlanta so looks like after all these years i may get a chance

no but seriously  we gotta start organizing away game meetups,Nationals,41,cz45ct,21,2019-09-03 16:23:10,i was sitting out in right field yesterday and the dulcet tones of the 7 train army rang in my ears all afternoon long it didnt help that joe ross gave up 7 runs in 3 23 innings but as obnoxious and humiliating as it was to see them all gathered down the third base line i couldnt help but admire them they were upbeat organized and loud like sports fans should be sorta reminded me of a small less rowdy version of european soccer ultras i know phillies fans do the same in dc to similarly infuriating results so it makes me wonder why we arent getting up and doing the same   there is of course the transient city issue as well as the relative newness of the nationals and the 30 years of no baseball didnt help either and i dunno how one would organize something like this but we cannot deny the fact that our i95 corridor rivals are packing our place with their folks and we seem to have zero response

juan soto sophomore slump no chance,Nationals,48,cyr5ek,10,2019-09-02 20:22:26,warning this is going to be a long post that gets pretty nerdy with stats if youre into that welcome if not hide your eyes    im here to discuss what adjustments soto has made from his rookie to sophomore campaigns even with how spectacular he was in 2018 there were doubters they made some fair arguments things like   he does almost the entirety of his damage on fastballs wait until pitchers start giving him a heavy dose of offspeed pitches   his groundball rate is too high to sustain this type of power   these things can be backed up by stats his groundball rate and production against nonfastballs were not good in 2018 lets give the kid a chance to adjust though well we have plenty of sample size from 2019 so let us dive in shall we   his groundball rate has dropped substantially from 539 to 409 with that his line drive rate has increased by 47 and fly ball rate has increased by 81 another stat thats very important to keep low if you want to be productive is infield fly ball rate basically popups that has dropped from 79 to 38 there have also been nice improvements in soft contact rate dropping 74 and hard contact rate increasing by 48 all this has helped translate into more powerproduction his slugging has increased dramatically from 517 to 578   now ill get into his production against specific pitch types these numbers measure the runs above average produced per 100 of these pitches on average his production against fastballs has actually fallen from 332 to 199 dont let that fool you 199 is still fantastic last year was just ridiculous hes improved from 021 to 184 against cutters 040 to 319 against curveballs 002 to 215 against changeups 172 to 443 against splitters the one pitch hes still negative against are sliders but even there hes improved slightly from 082 to 059 hes also been more aggressive this year his swing rate against pitches out of the strike zone has risen slightly by 17 while his swing rate in the strike zone has risen by 84 that added aggressiveness has not hurt him though as his walk rate and strikeout rate have stayed about the same   his most elite category obp has stayed the same if this season has proven anything its that the doubters were wrong and that he truly is a special pure hitter to see these types of adjustments in his second season tells me hes going to only get progressively better as he climbs through his prime he reminds me of joey votto in his prime but with more power cant wait to watch his career unfold

should we be concerned that this team has no lefty specialist,Nationals,11,cxlyee,10,2019-08-30 23:50:54,at this current moment the only left handed reliever on the team is roenis elias but left handed hitters have hit 346 against him this season so while he throws with his left hand he isnt good at getting lefties out the only other lefty on the nats is doolittle and while he is great against left handed hitters hes the closer so he is put in the 9th no matter what handedness the batters are that means that both lefties on the nats arent really usable against left handed hittersexcluding the 9th inning because of doo and while yes hudson is great against lefties and strickland and rodney are decent too the nationals lack the player to give a lefty a tough lefty on lefty ab in big situations during the playoffs this will be crucial like if freddie freeman or anthony rizzo are up in key spots in the 7th or 8th which is too early to put in doo looking at all the other playoff teams they have left handed relievers who dominate left handed batters like zach britton jerry blevins kyle ryan tyler webb andrew miller ect should we be worried that we lack someone like that

i may be going to a game for the first time since 2011 next month what has and hasnt changed at nats park since then,Nationals,18,cshid4,27,2019-08-19 18:03:35,i lived in dc during the 200811 seasons and made it to nats games on a somewhat regular basis during that period heck my wife and i met when a common friend canceled out of going to the preseason game we had against the red sox in 2010 we relocated during the 201112 offseason as i was out of work and she was homesick and we havent had a chance to go back until now  im coming back solo as being home alone for four days while shes on business isnt the best idea and there are things i think about dc that need to be debunked my trip overlaps with the last series with the phillies and im thinking of going to a game probably with a friend who isnt a baseball fan i know the area leading to the navy yard was built up and filled but what are some recommendations knowing that the last time i was there it was the bullpen andthe bullpen  also as this is a phillies series what 34 did to you was dastardly as hell but is it okay to boo him at this point its a shame that i have to leave before the tuesday day game that sadly looks like a recipe for cbps syndrome heres hoping that those games are meaningful for the nats and not for them
